# de.uks.se.gamde.GraphentechnikWS1516

Source code for the Graph and Model Driven Engineering course of university of kassel in winter term 2015/16.

> Ein Graph ist ein 7-Tupel.

The implemented project develops a graph simulation tools for a simple graph modeling language with graph transformations and semantic operation terms. It also includes a simple json de-serialization for graphical usage. It is approached to the modeling tool Groove by Arend Rensink.

Contact [jan-chr.hess@student.uni-kassel.de](mailto:jan-chr.hess@student.uni-kassel.de) for all questions, remarks, etc.

## exercises:
- exercise 1: data model + testingClasses.
